  <AboutMe>"Who're you going to call?! Ghostbusters!"

When dealing with trivial problems, you'll need to find an expert on them.
Meet Henry, the 12th grader who's still in highschool.

Sure, he isn't like the adults that grind their teeth when their coffee mugs are stained, but he's got his fair share of first-world problems.
From stomach aches in the subway to burning out over an app idea; he's got the experience of a 34 year old salary man who's seen it all.

Not that he is a 34 year old salary man.</AboutMe>
